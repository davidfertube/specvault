## Performance

Evaluated against 80 golden queries across 8 ASTM/API documents (Claude Sonnet 4.5, February 2026):

| Metric | Result | Target | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Overall Accuracy** | **91.3%** (73/80) | 90%+ | ✅ Exceeded |
| **Source Citation** | **96.3%** (77/80) | 90%+ | ✅ Exceeded |
| **Hallucination Rate** | **~0%** | 0% | ✅ Maintained |
| **P50 / P95 Latency** | 13.0s / 24.2s | <30s (P95) | ✅ Within target |
| **Post-Dedup Test** | **100%** (10/10) | — | ✅ Validated |
| **Production Smoke** | **100%** (8/8) | — | ✅ Passing |
| **Unit Tests** | **113/113** | 100% | ✅ 0 skipped |

**Complex multi-hop queries** (comparisons, multi-spec analysis) score **96.9%** — higher than single-lookup queries due to the query decomposition agent.

### Recent Improvements (Feb 2026)

**Document Deduplication**: Removed 46 duplicate documents (7,454 redundant chunks) through content-hash deduplication. Reduced noise by ~75% while maintaining accuracy.

**Voyage AI Cross-Encoder**: Replaced LLM-based reranking with Voyage AI rerank-2 as primary strategy. **10-50x faster** (~200ms vs 5-15s) with equal or better relevance scoring.

**Dynamic TopK**: Adaptive retrieval depth — 8 chunks for API specs and cross-spec comparisons, 5 for standard ASTM queries. Balances coverage and precision.

**Confidence Reweighting**: Tuned weights to `retrieval 35% + grounding 25% + coherence 40%` based on production failure analysis. Reduced false confidence by 18%.

**Feedback Loop**: Thumbs up/down with issue classification + diagnostic reporting. Production feedback automatically classified and routed to relevant pipeline modules.

```

**Stage Details:**

| Stage | Module | Key Features |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| **1. Query Analysis** | `query-preprocessing.ts` | Extracts UNS/ASTM/API codes, sets adaptive search weights |
| **2. Decomposition** | `multi-query-rag.ts` | Expands complex queries into parallel sub-queries |
| **3. Hybrid Search** | `hybrid-search.ts` | BM25 + vector fusion with document-scoped filtering |
| **4. Re-ranking** | `reranker.ts` | Voyage AI rerank-2 (primary, ~200ms) + LLM fallback, dynamic topK |
| **5. Generation** | `chat/route.ts` | Claude Sonnet 4.5 with chain-of-thought system prompt |
| **6. Verification** | `answer-grounding.ts`, `response-validator.ts` | Regex numerical verification + LLM coherence judge |
| **7. Confidence Gate** | `chat/route.ts` | Weighted score (35/25/40), regenerates if < 55% |

**Post-Generation Agents:**

| Agent | Method | Purpose | Regen Budget |
|-------|--------|---------|--------------|
| **Answer Grounding** | Regex (no LLM) | Verify numerical claims match source chunks | 1 |
| **Anti-Refusal** | Pattern matching | Catch false "I cannot answer" responses | 2 |
| **Partial Refusal** | Pattern matching | Catch hedged "limited information" responses | 2 |
| **Coherence Validation** | LLM judge (fast) | Ensure response addresses the question | 2 |

Shared regeneration budget: **max 3 attempts total** across all agents to prevent infinite loops.

## Engineering Highlights

### 🎯 Self-Correcting Agentic Pipeline

Post-generation agents detect hallucinated numbers, false refusals, and incoherent responses. Each verification step can trigger targeted regeneration with specific guidance. The system catches errors that would pass through a naive retrieve-and-generate pipeline.

**Key innovation**: Shared regeneration budget (max 3) prevents infinite loops while allowing multiple correction attempts. Each agent provides specific feedback to guide regeneration.

### 🔬 Cross-Spec Contamination Prevention

**Problem**: A789 (tubing) and A790 (pipe) share ~90% of their content but have **different** mechanical properties for the same UNS designations. S32205 yields **70 ksi** in A789 but **65 ksi** in A790.

**Solution**: `document-mapper.ts` resolves ASTM/API codes to specific document IDs. Hybrid search uses document-scoped filtering. Content-level dedup is per-document, not global. Cross-spec confusion matrix testing validates separation.

### 📊 Table-Preserving Semantic Chunking

Variable-size chunks (1500 target, 800 min, 2500 max, 200 overlap) detect table boundaries and keep them intact. ASTM specification tables — the primary source of mechanical property data — are never split mid-row.

**Trade-off analysis**: Larger chunks improve coverage but risk TPM limits on fallback providers. Smaller chunks prevent cross-contamination but may fragment context. 1500-char target balances both.

### 📈 Evaluation-Driven Development

**80 golden queries** with pattern-based validation across 8 ASTM/API documents. RAGAS LLM-as-judge metrics. A789/A790 confusion matrix testing.

**Accuracy progression**: 57% (naive RAG) → 81% (hybrid search) → **91.3%** (agentic pipeline) through systematic root cause analysis and targeted improvements.

**Test pyramid**:
- 113 unit tests (pipeline components, chunk boundaries, query parsing)
- 80 golden queries (end-to-end accuracy, pattern validation)
- 8 production smoke tests (complex multi-hop queries)
- 10 post-improvement validation (dedup verification, confidence calibration)

### 🔄 Production Feedback Loop

**In-app feedback**: Thumbs up/down with issue classification (false refusal, wrong data, missing info, hallucination, etc.) + free-form comment.

**Diagnostic automation**: `scripts/feedback-report.ts` reads feedback, classifies root causes, generates actionable reports pointing to specific pipeline modules. Automated issue routing to relevant `lib/*.ts` files.

**Feedback storage**: `supabase/feedback-migration.sql` — stores query, response, sources, confidence, rating, issue_type, comment with timestamps.

### ⚡ Voyage AI Cross-Encoder Re-ranking

Voyage AI rerank-2 replaces LLM-based reranking as the primary strategy. **10-50x faster** (~200ms vs 5-15s) with equal or better relevance scoring. LLM reranking available as fallback.

**Dynamic topK**: 8 chunks for API specs and cross-spec comparisons, 5 for standard ASTM queries. Balances coverage (API specs are broader, less structured) and precision (ASTM specs are highly tabular).

**Chunk window**: Truncates to 800 chars (preserves ~6-8 table rows including headers). Trade-off: longer context improves scoring but slows reranking.

### 🛡️ Multi-Provider LLM Failover

`model-fallback.ts` chains **Anthropic → Groq → Cerebras → SambaNova → OpenRouter** with progressive backoff (500ms × 2^n, cap 4s). Zero-downtime on any single provider outage.

**Timeout architecture**: `withTimeout` wrappers with fail-open for non-critical LLM calls. Critical path (generation) uses 45s timeout. Non-critical (coherence validation) uses 15s with graceful degradation.

**Rate limit handling**: Detects 429 errors, auto-switches providers, logs fallback chain. Production monitoring tracks provider health and latency distribution.

### 🧹 Content-Hash Deduplication

**Impact**: Removed 46 duplicate documents (7,454 redundant chunks). **~75% noise reduction** while maintaining 100% accuracy on post-dedup validation.

**Implementation**: `scripts/dedup-documents.ts` generates MD5 content hashes, groups duplicates, keeps newest version. SQL migration: `supabase/dedup-migration.sql`.

**Trade-off**: Aggressive dedup (80%+ vocabulary overlap) risks removing legitimate variations. Content-hash approach (exact match) is conservative but safe.
